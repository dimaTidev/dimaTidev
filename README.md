# About Me:
Iâ€™m a full-stack and backend engineer with 10+ years of experience building reliable, scalable, and AI-driven systems. Iâ€™ve led teams, designed automation platforms, and developed tools that make complex systems easier to use and maintain.

My work spans AI agents, backend infrastructure, and frontends. Some areas I work with include:

- AI agents using LangGraph and ADK
- RAG systems with vector databases and knowledge graphs
- MCP servers and automation platforms
- CI/CD pipelines for linting, building, testing, and deploying to AWS
- IaC using Terraform
- Monitoring systems and observability setups
- API development with REST and GraphQL
- Microservices and ETL pipelines
- Database backups and data management
- Auth services using OAuth
- 3rd-party integrations and security practices (XSS, CSRF, etc.)

I enjoy building systems that scale, perform well, and make developersâ€™ lives easier.

Feel free to reach out. Iâ€™d love to connect or hear about new opportunities.
